    <b>Establishment:</b> The ultimate aim of all educational practices is the development of the human being. The final goal of all endeavors is to foster human development. The practice that can channel the human willpower and creativity in a disciplined manner for fruitful outcomes is called education.

    Inspired by Swami Vivekananda, the Jay Narayan Charitable Trust, led by Dr. Ishwar Chandra Gupta and his associates, purchased a 7,600 square meter plot in Lakhimpur from Kanpur Development Authority, as part of the Vidya Bharati school series. Construction of the grand building of Vidya Mandir commenced on this land as soon as the foundation stone was laid by Rishi Madhav Rao Devalle on November 18, 1996.
    <br><br>  <br>
    It took nearly two years to complete the construction of one section (ground floor) of this land. On December 4, 1998, the building was inaugurated by the National Convener of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Shri Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya), and from July 1998, the Jay Narayan Vidya Mandir began its journey in this magnificent building, shining like a bright star in the firmament of the education world, consistently progressing in its development, covering its golden pages of life from 1998 to 2014.
    <br><br><br>
<b>Campus:</b> In memory of the respected father of the great social thinker Dr. Ishwar Chandra Gupta, this Vidya Mandir operates, with the dream of the restoration of Sanskrit and culture. Starting with just 250 students, it has continuously progressed and today, it is a well-established intermediate college with recognition in the Science and Commerce streams. Currently, this multi-block building has 30 classrooms, 4 administrative rooms, 4 laboratories, 2 spacious auditoriums, an art gallery, a science gallery, a mathematics gallery, a music room, 22 residential rooms, 2 lecture rooms, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, a guest room, and the principal's residence. In this modern and well-equipped building, around 50 proficient and hardworking teachers are guiding approximately 1400 students.
